  abstract = {Neural networks are composed of basic units somewhat analogous to
	neurons. These units are linked to each other by connections whose
	strength is modifiable as a result of a learning process or algorithm.
	Each of these units integrates independently (in parallel) the information
	provided by its synapses in order to evaluate its state of activation.
	The unit response is then a linear or nonlinear function of its activation.
	Linear algebra concepts are used, in general, to analyze linear units,
	with eigenvectirs and eigenvalues being the core concepts involved.
	This analysis makes clear the strong similarite between linear neural
	networks and the general linear model developed by statisticians.
	The linar models presented here are the perceptron, and the linear
	associator. The behavior of nonlinear networks can be described within
	the framework of optimization and approximation techniques with dynamical
	systems (e.g., like those used to model spin glasses). One of the
	main notions used with nonlinear unit networks is the notioon of
	attractor. When the task of the network is to associate a response
	with some specific input patterns, the most popular nonlinear technique
	consists of using hidden layers of neurons trained with back-propagation
	of error. The nonlinear models presented are the Hopfield network,
	the Boltzmann machine, the back-propagation network, and the radial
	basis function network.},

	low energy (MeV) gamma-rays can escape these compact objects with

	given that in most cases the accretion disks within 10 Schwarzschild
	radii Rg radiate with a power exceeding 10 percent of the Eddington
	luminosity, LEdd. Therefore the high energy gamma-ray emission of
	these objects (both of stellar mass and super-massive BHs) is generally
	suppressed, and consequently the unique information on possible particle
	acceleration processes near the event horizon of the BH is essentially
	lost. Fortunately this is not the case for the super-massive BH located
	at the dynamical center of our Galaxy (Sgr A*), which thanks to its

	different scenarios of gamma-ray production in Sgr A*, and show that

	fluxes of both hadronic and electronic origin. Some of these scenarios
	are applicable not only for the TeV gamma-ray emission recently reported
	from the direction of Galactic Center, but may have broader implications
	relevant to highly variable nonthermal emission of Sgr A* in radio,

  abstract = {The organization of CA1 projections to the rat subiculum was investigated
	with the anterograde tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L).
	Discrete iontophoretic injections of PHA-L were placed into various
	transverse positions of the CA1 field at different septotemporal
	levels of the hippocampus. The distribution of CA1 projections was
	observed in dissected and extended hippocampal preparations. CA1
	cells located proximally in the field, i.e., close to the CA2 field,
	gave rise to projections that terminated in the distal third of the
	subiculum, i.e., close to the presubiculum. CA1 cells located distally
	in the field, i.e., close to the subiculum, gave rise to projections
	that terminated proximally in the subiculum, i.e., just across the
	CA1/subiculum border. CA1 cells in the middle of the field projected
	to a midtransverse portion of the subiculum. The same general pattern
	of projections was observed at all septotemporal levels of the hippocampus.
	Varicose fibers from the CA1 neurons terminated among the basal dendrites
	of the subicular pyramidal cells, within the pyramidal cell layer,
	and in the deep portion of the molecular layer. In addition to the
	CA1 to subiculum projections, the discrete PHA-L injections provided
	the opportunity of examining the extent of local and associational
	connections within CA1. In general, associational connections in
	CA1 are far less extensive than in CA3. CA1 is not entirely without
	local connections, however. CA1 cells located close to the subicular
	border, for example, originated axons that first innervated the proximal
	subiculum and then reentered the CA1 field at the interface between
	stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum-moleculare. In most of the
	experimental cases, there were collaterals located in stratum oriens
	of CA1 that branched from the fibers directed toward the subiculum.
	Thus, the basal dendrites of CA1 cells may receive associational
	inputs. The organization of the CA1 projections to the subiculum
	is discussed in relation to the organization of CA3 projections to
	CA1 and the differential output of transverse regions of the subiculum.
	The possibility is raised that information may be "channeled" through
	the hippocampal formation via the transverse organization of these
	connections and ultimately distributed to different recipients of
	hippocampal efferent projections.},

	on this subject. Although first generalizations of this concept to
	particle physics were made recently, these results were not systematized.
	In this review we summarize this development and discuss similarities
	and differences of the appearence of the pseudogap phase in superconductors
	and the Gross-Neveu and NambuÂ–Jona-Lasinio - like models. We discuss
	its possible relevance for chiral phase transition in QCD and color

	formation and pair condensation in strong - coupling and low carrier
	density superconductors (i.e. the formation of the pseudogap phase
	). Second part is a review of nonlinear sigma model approach to an
	analogous phenomenon in the Chiral Gross-Neveu model at small N.

	cooperative, massively parallel system. The first class of models
	and accompanying solution methods were constructed to carry out tasks
	in perceptual inferencing, such as the segmentation of a scene into
	its component surfaces, figureÂ–ground segregation, and object recognition.
	In these computer-based approaches we construct a Markov random field
	(MRF) to capture correlations in a visual image and then use simulated
	annealing, or one of its siblings, to generate sequences of small
	changes. The solution methods are stochastic in character; the computations
	are intrinsically parallel and are inspired by our thinking about
	how the early stages of visual processing might occur in the brain.
	The second class of mathematical models and methods has as its central
	theme the notion of assembly coding. These models and methods were
	developed to carry out the same tasks as those in the first class,
	but we now construct families of coupled first-order ordinary differential
	equations that describe circuits of interconnected neurons. We then
	evolve these nonlinear dynamical systems through sequences of states
	that converge to fixed points, limit cycles, or chaotic attractors.
	The solution methods can be either deterministic or stochastic; the
	computations are parallel and highly distributed, and they model
	circuits found in the mammalian brain.},

	provide a statistical methodology for classifying data points into

	a small subset of discriminatory features (relevant feature identification).
	However, this and other extant classification methods address only
	implicitly the issue of observed data being a combination of underlying
	signals and noise. Recently, robust optimization has emerged as a
	powerful framework for handling uncertain data explicitly. Here,
	ideas from this field are exploited to develop robust sparse hyperplanes,
	i.e., classification and relevant feature identification algorithms
	that are resilient to variation in the data. Specifically, each data

	of breast cancer related transcript profiles. Data-dependent heuristics
	are used to compute the parameters of each ellipsoidal data uncertainty

	the response patterns of perirhinal neurons that signal information

	very fast and accurate familiarity discrimination while employing
	biologically plausible parameters and Hebbian learning rules. The
	fact that the activity patterns of the modelï¾’s simulated neurons
	are closely similar to those of neurons recorded from the primate
	perirhinal cortex indicates that this brain region could discriminate
	familiarity using principles akin to those of the model. If so, the
	capacity of the model establishes that the perirhinal cortex alone
	may discriminate the familiarity of many more stimuli than current
	neural network models indicate could be recalled (recollected) by
	all the remaining areas of the cerebral cortex. This efficiency and

	equilibrium if players with high degrees of strategic thinking mimic
	or erase the effects of others who do very little strategic thinking.
	Recently developed theories of other-regarding preferences and bounded

  abstract = {Behavioral performance in detection and discrimination tasks is likely
	to be limited by the quality and nature of the signals carried by
	populations of neurons in early sensory cortical areas. Here we used
	voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) to directly measure neural population
	responses in the primary visual cortex (V1) of monkeys performing
	a reaction-time detection task. Focusing on the temporal properties
	of the population responses, we found that V1 responses are consistent
	with a stimulus-evoked response with amplitude and latency that depend
	on target contrast and a stimulus-independent additive noise with
	long-lasting temporal correlations. The noise had much lower amplitude
	than the ongoing activity reported previously in anesthetized animals.
	To understand the implications of these properties for subsequent
	processing stages that mediate behavior, we derived the Bayesian
	ideal observer that specifies how to optimally use neural responses
	in reaction time tasks. Using the ideal observer analysis, we show
	that 1) the observed temporal correlations limit the performance
	benefit that can be attained by accumulating V1 responses over time,
	2) a simple temporal decorrelation operation with time-lagged excitation
	and inhibition minimizes the detrimental effect of these correlations,
	3) the neural information relevant for target detection is concentrated
	in the initial response following stimulus onset, and 4) a decoder
	that optimally uses V1 responses far outperforms the monkey in both
	speed and accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that for our particular
	detection task, temporal decorrelation followed by an appropriate
	running integrator can approach the speed and accuracy of the optimal
	decoder.},

	Results: We pursue the hypothesis that the axon caliber has evolved

	diameters of mother and daughter branches at a bifurcation satisfy

	which are full-search equivalent - that is, the resulting match is
	as good as what we could obtain if we were to search the set exhaustively.
	We propose a framework made up of three components, namely (i) a
	technique for obtaining a good initial match, (ii) an inexpensive
	method for determining whether the current match is a full-search
	equivalent match, and (iii) an effective technique for improving
	the current match. Our approach is to consider good solutions for
	each component in order to find an algorithm which balances the overall
	complexity of the search. We also propose a technique for hierarchical
	ordering and cluster elimination using a minimal cost spanning tree.
	Our experiments on vector quantisation coding of images show that
	the framework and techniques we proposed can be used to construct
	suitable algorithms for most of our data sets which require full-search
	equivalent matches at an average arithmetic cost of less than O(k

  abstract = {The axon collaterals of dentate granule cells have been analyzed with
	the aid of a computerized microscope, following intracellular injections
	of horseradish peroxidase in hippocampal slice preparations. The
	axon of each granule cell gives rise to approximately seven primary
	collaterals; these collaterals usually divide into secondary and
	tertiary branches, which form an extensive plexus within the hilar
	region of the dentate gyrus. Individual axon collaterals vary greatly
	in length, but most have been found to be between 100 and 300 microns
	long. On average, the summed lengths of the collaterals (exclusive
	of the parent mossy fiber) are approximately 2,300 microns. Except
	for an occasional collateral that is given off by a mossy fiber in
	the proximal part of field CA3 of the hippocampus, the collaterals
	of the granule cell axons are confined to the hilar region; they
	are rarely seen in the granule cell layer itself and have never been
	observed in the molecular layer. In the longitudinal dimension of
	the dentate gyrus, most of the collaterals are contained within a
	zone about 400 microns wide. The distribution of the collaterals
	within the hilar region is correlated with the location of the granule
	cell body. Those that arise from cells near the tip of the suprapyramidal
	blade tend to be confined to the region above field CA3; those from
	cells nearer the crest and from the infrapyramidal blade ramify widely
	throughout the hilus. Two types of varicosities are present on the
	collaterals. Numerous small (approximately 2 microns), round varicosities
	are distributed unevenly along the collaterals; in electron micrographs
	these varicosities can be seen to make asymmetric synaptic contacts
	with dendritic shafts. On average, each granule cell collateral plexus
	has about 160 of these varicosities. The second type of varicosity
	is irregular in shape and ranges from 2 to 4 microns in diameter;
	there is usually only one such varicosity per collateral. In all
	respects except size, these varicosities resemble the expansions
	found on the parent mossy fibers. Mossy fiber trajectories in the
	proximal part of field CA3 were studied after extracellular injections
	of HRP into localized regions of the granule cell layer. Granule
	cells at different locations around the blade send their mossy fibers
	to different depths within the pyramidal cell layer in the proximal
	part of field CA3. However, further distally, mossy fibers from all
	parts of the granule cell layer contribute to the suprapyramidal
	bundle that occupies the stratum lucidum.},

	discovering network topology solely from host-based, unicast measure-
	ments, without internal network cooperation. First, we in- troduce
	a novel delay-based measurement scheme that does not require clock
	synchronization, making it more practical than other previous proposals.
	Due to the nature of the measurement procedure, our methodology has
	the potential to identify layer two switching elements (provided
	they are logical topology branching points and induce some measur-
	able switching delay). Second, we propose a maximum pe- nalized likelihood
	criterion for topology identification. This is a global optimality
	criterion, in contrast to other recent proposals for topology identification
	that employ subopti- mal, pair-merging strategies. We develop a novel
	Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure for rapid determi- nation
	of the most likely topologies. The performance of our new probing

	which leads to a double power series for the Green's functions of
	the cutoff theory in terms of 1/e^2 and Lambda^2/M^2. Lambda is a

	to control the broken gauge invariance of the cutoff theory. Restricting
	to d=2 (the Schwinger model) we show how to remove the cutoff using
	Pade approximants. We find some evidence that as Lambda^2/M^2->infty
	gauge invariance is restored and we calculate the vector-meson mass,
	keeping the first three terms in the expansion in powers of the bare
	photon inverse propagator.},

	the case in which dark matter particles not only have strong self-interactions
	but also have strong interactions with baryons. The presence of such
	interactions will have direct implications for nuclear and particle
	astrophysics. Among these are a change in the predicted abundances
	from big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the flux of Î³-rays produced
	by the decay of neutral pions which originate in collisions between
	dark matter and Galactic cosmic rays (CR). From these effects we
	constrain the strength of the baryonÂ–dark matter interactions through
	the ratio of baryon - dark matter interaction cross section to dark
	matter mass, s. We find that BBN places a weak upper limit to this
	ratio <âˆ¼ 108 cm2 gâˆ’1. CR-SIDM interactions, however, limit the
	possible DM-baryon cross section to <âˆ¼ 5 Ã— 10âˆ’3 cm2 gâˆ’1; this

	the characteristics of EPSPs at the synaptic sites and surprisingly
	small attenuation along the trunk of the primary dendrite. Also,
	the experiments were performed to determine the number, location,

	origin (glomerular tuft) and to determine its attenuation along the
	entire length of the primary dendrite. This attenuation corresponds
	to an unusually large mean apparent "length constant" of the primary
	dendrite. Furthermore, the images of spike trigger zones showed that
	an action potential can be initiated in three different compartments
	of the mitral cell: the soma-axon region, the primary dendrite trunk,
	and the terminal dendritic tuft, which appears to be fully excitable.
	Finally, secondary dendrites clearly support the active propagation
	of action potentials.},

	projection neurons of the olfactory bulb, is one of the key factors
	in understanding olfaction. We used combined calcium and voltage
	imaging from the same neuron and computer modeling to investigate
	signal processing in the mitral cells, focusing on the glomerular
	dendritic tuft. The main finding was that the dendritic tuft functions
	as a single electrical compartment for subthreshold signals within
	the range of amplitudes detectable by voltage-sensitive dye recording.
	These evoked EPSPs had uniform characteristics throughout the glomerular
	tuft. The Ca2+ transients associated with spatially uniform subthreshold
	synaptic potentials were comparable but not equal in amplitude in
	all regions. The average range of normalized amplitudes of the EPSP-driven
	Ca2+ signals from different locations on dendritic branches in the
	glomerular tuft was relatively narrow and appeared to be independent
	of the dendritic surface-to-volume ratio. The computer simulations
	constrained by the imaging data indicated that a synchronized activation
	of [~]100 synapses randomly distributed on tuft branches was sufficient
	to generate spatially homogenous EPSPs. This number of activated
	synapses is consistent with the data from anatomical studies. Furthermore,
	voltage attenuation of the EPSP along the primary dendrite at physiological
	temperature was weak compared with other cell types. In the model,
	weak attenuation of the EPSP along the primary dendrite could be
	accounted for by passive electrical properties of the mitral cell.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Analysis of brain ultrastructure is needed to reveal how
	neurons communicate with one another via synapses and how disease
	processes alter this communication. In the past, such analyses have
	usually been based on single or paired sections obtained by electron
	microscopy. Reconstruction from multiple serial sections provides
	a much needed, richer representation of the three-dimensional organization
	of the brain. This paper introduces a new reconstruction system and
	new methods for analyzing in three dimensions the location and ultrastructure
	of neuronal components, such as synapses, which are distributed non-randomly
	throughout the brain. DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: Volumes are reconstructed
	by defining transformations that align the entire area of adjacent
	sections. Whole-field alignment requires rotation, translation, skew,
	scaling, and second-order nonlinear deformations. Such transformations
	are implemented by a linear combination of bivariate polynomials.
	Computer software for generating transformations based on user input
	is described. Stereological techniques for assessing structural distributions
	in reconstructed volumes are the unbiased bricking, disector, unbiased
	ratio, and per-length counting techniques. A new general method,
	the fractional counter, is also described. This unbiased technique
	relies on the counting of fractions of objects contained in a test
	volume. A volume of brain tissue from stratum radiatum of hippocampal
	area CA1 is reconstructed and analyzed for synaptic density to demonstrate
	and compare the techniques. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Reconstruction
	makes practicable volume-oriented analysis of ultrastructure using
	such techniques as the unbiased bricking and fractional counter methods.
	These analysis methods are less sensitive to the section-to-section
	variations in counts and section thickness, factors that contribute
	to the inaccuracy of other stereological methods. In addition, volume
	reconstruction facilitates visualization and modeling of structures
	and analysis of three-dimensional relationships such as synaptic
	connectivity.},

	antibody against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the acetylcholine-synthesizing
	enzyme. In general, ChAT-immunoreactive cells were rare, but were
	observed in all layers of the hippocampus proper and fascia dentata
	with a preponderance in zones adjacent to the hippocampal fissure
	and in the part of CA1 bordering the subiculum. All immunoreactive
	cells found were non-pyramidal neurons. They were relatively small
	with round or ovoid perikarya, which gave rise to thin spine-free
	dendrites. These hippocampal neurons were very similar to ChAT-immunoreactive
	cells in the neocortex of the same animals but were quite different
	from cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain, medial septal nucleus,
	and neostriatum, which were larger and more intensely immunostained.
	Electron-microscopic analysis of ChAT-immunoreactive cells in the
	hippocampus and fascia dentata revealed synaptic contacts, mainly
	of the asymmetric type, on cell bodies and smooth proximal dendrites.
	The nuclei of the immunoreactive cells exhibited deep indentations,
	which are characteristic for non-pyramidal neurons. Our results provide
	evidence for an intrinsic source of the hippocampal cholinergic innervation
	in addition to the well-established septo-hippocampal cholinergic
	projection.},

	The spike-driven synaptic dynamics described here can implement such
	a selection mechanism to achieve slow learning, which is shown to
	maximize the performance of the network as an associative memory.},

	are, however, frequently oriented perpendicular to tissue surfaces,

	planes arbitrarily oriented in 3D, which proved particularly beneficial
	for calcium imaging of parallel fibers and Purkinje cell dendrites
	in rat cerebellar cortex. Second, we applied free linescanseither
	through multiple dendrites or along a single vertically oriented
	dendriteto reveal fast dendritic calcium dynamics in neocortical
	pyramidal neurons. Finally, we invented a ribbon-type 3D scanning
	method for imaging user-defined convoluted planes enabling simultaneous
	measurements of calcium signals along multiple apical dendrites.
	These novel scanning modes will facilitate optical probing of dendritic

	The approach is based on a normalization procedure that is used to

	equivalent to conservation of heat, or the local rst law; entropy
	is a local current; and non-destruction of entropy, or the local
	second law. A uid is defined by the thermostatic energy tensor being
	isotropic. The entropy current is related to the other yields by
	certain equations, including a generalised Gibbs equation for the
	thermostatic entropy, followed by linear and quadratic terms in the
	dissipative (thermal minus thermostatic) energy tensor. Then the
	second law suggests certain equations for the dissipative energy
	tensor, generalising the Israel-Stewart dissipative relations, which
	describe heat conduction and viscosity including relativistic effects
	and relaxation effects. In the thermostatic case, the perfect-liquid
	model is recovered. In the linear approximation for entropy, the
	Eckart theory is recovered. In the quadratic approximation for entropy,
	the theory is similar to that of Israel & Stewart, but involving
	neither state-space differentials, nor a non-equilibrium Gibbs equation,
	nor non-material frames. Also, unlike conventional thermodynamics,
	the thermal energy density is not assumed to be purely thermostatic,
	though this is derived in the linear approximation. Otherwise, the
	theory reduces in the non-relativistic limit to the extended thermodynamics
	of irreversible processes due to Muller. The dissipative energy density
	seems to be a new thermodynamical eld, but also exists in relativistic
	kinetic theory of gases.},

	coordinate space. A corresponding momentum path integral may also
	be defined through Fourier transforms in the endpoints. These momentum
	path integrals are especially simple for several special cases, yet
	no one has, to my knowledge, ever formally constructed them from
	first principles, i.e., by considering all classical paths in momentum

	classical mechanics based on an alternate classical action, R. Hamiltonï¾’s
	Canonical equations result from a variational principle in both S

	fixed beginning and ending momentum points. This alternative actionï¾’s

	also present some important subtle points concerning the beginning
	and ending conditions on the action necessary to apply a Canonical
	transformation. These properties explain the failure of the Canonical
	transformation in the phase space path integral. It follows that
	a path integral may be formulated from first principles using S in
	the coordinate representation, or R, in the momentum representation.
	Several example calculations are presented that illustrate this broader
	view of the path integral. In particular, the normalized amplitude
	for a free particle is found without using the SchrÃ¶dinger equation,
	the internal spin degree of freedom is simply and naturally derived,

  note = {This paper provides an overview to black hole Hocking's radiation

  abstract = {The prediction that black holes radiate due to quantum effects is
	often considered one of the most secure in quantum field theory in
	curved spaceÂ–time. Yet this prediction rests on two dubious assumptions:
	that ordinary physics may be applied to vacuum fluctuations at energy
	scales increasing exponentially without bound; and that quantumÂ–gravitational
	effects may be neglected. Various suggestions have been put forward
	to address these issues: that they might be explained away by lessons
	from sonic black hole models; that the prediction is indeed successfully
	reproduced by quantum gravity; that the success of the link provided
	by the prediction between black holes and thermodynamics justifies
	the prediction. This paper explains the nature of the difficulties,
	and reviews the proposals that have been put forward to deal with
	them. None of the proposals put forward can so far be considered
	to be really successful, and simple dimensional arguments show that
	quantumÂ–gravitational effects might well alter the evaporation process
	outlined by Hawking. Thus a definitive theoretical treatment will
	require an understanding of quantum gravity in at least some regimes.
	Until then, no compelling theoretical case for or against radiation
	by black holes is likely to be made. The possibility that nonÂ–radiating
	ï¾“miniï¾” black holes exist should be taken seriously; such holes
	could be part of the dark matter in the Universe. Attempts to place
	observational limits on the number of ï¾“miniï¾” black holes (independent

	at different portions of the boundary; and it is frequently a challenge

	statistical. We present a novel image-match model for use in Bayesian
	segmentation, a multiscale extension of image profile models akin
	to those in Active Shape Models. A spherical-harmonic based 3D shape
	representation provides a mapping of the object boundary to the sphere
	S2, and a scale-space for profiles on the sphere defines a scalespace
	on the object. A key feature is that profiles are not blurred across
	the object boundary, but only along the boundary. This profile scalespace
	is sampled in a coarse-to-fine fashion to produce features for the
	statistical image-match model. A framework for model-building and
	segmentation has been built, and testing and validation are in progress
	with a dataset of 70 segmented images of the caudate nucleus.},

  note = {The paper deals with the question how a network subjected to plasticity
	may maintain stability in performing its task [here odor recognition
	in olfaction] in the presence of changes noise due to plasticity.
	The question is addressed on the example of artificial neural network
	for olfaction odor recognition. The plasticity rule is as follows:
	a value function is assigned for each presynaptic neuron depending
	on the time difference between pre \& postsynaptic cells firings.
	This is a bell shaped function promoting value of neurons firing
	in synchrony with two negative wings suppressing neurons that also
	fire out of synchrony [all the time]. After each postsynaptic cell
	firing, all presynaptic connections are removed and a fixed number
	[200] of new connections with the highest values are made. System
	shows stability of recognition despite drastic update rule and ability
	to learn by initially broadly tuned cell the odor at which original
	synaptic update was initiated. Conjecture is made that general learning
	rule which favor better synchrony will result in rearrangement of
	connections toward "sooner" spiking. This is said to be related to
	the "center of mass" of the "value" curve associated with learning.
	Small tail of positive values for "negative" relative timings is
	needed to prevent such drift due to zeroing the center of mass. This
	is said to reflect the fact that due to jitter in timing relevant
	cells some times may fire before postsynaptic cell and by this should
	be given credit in learning rule. General bottomline is as follows:
	"conservatism" allows system to maintain its function even in the
	presence of substantial plasticity: as long as majority follows the
	same route, changes in the system will not disrupt its function;
	conservatism here is implemented via synchrony criteria - when many
	cells spike together, noise in their spiking may be overwhelmed by
	presence of the cells number. I don't really buy right away the arguments
	about drift and center of mass of learning curve.},

	the firing patterns of a functioning network. These plasticity rules
	for self-repair also provide the basis for unsupervised learning
	of new tasks. The particular plasticity rule derived for a network
	depends on the network and task. Here, self-repair is illustrated
	for a model of the mammalian olfactory system in which the computational
	task is that of odor recognition. In this olfactory example, the
	derived rule has qualitative similarity with experimental results
	seen in spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Unsupervised learning
	of new tasks by using the derived self-repair rule is demonstrated
	by learning to recognize new odors.},

  year = {|2005|},
  pages = {1},
  abstract = {This year, the field of neuroscience celebrates the 50th anniversary
	of Mountcastleï¾’s discovery of the cortical column. In this review,we
	summarize half a century of research and come to the disappointing
	realization that the column may have no function. Originally, it
	was described as a discrete structure, spanning the layers of the
	somatosensory cortex, which contains cells responsive to only a single
	modality, such as deep joint receptors or cutaneous receptors. Subsequently,
	examples of columns have been uncovered in numerous cortical areas,
	expanding the original concept to embrace a variety of different
	structures and principles. A ï¾‘columnï¾’ now refers to cells in
	any vertical cluster that share the same tuning for any given receptive
	field attribute. In striate cortex, for example, cells with the same
	eye preference are grouped into ocular dominance columns. Unaccountably,
	ocular dominance columns are present in some species, but not others.
	In principle, it should be possible to determine their function by
	searching for species differences in visual performance that correlate
	with their presence or absence. Unfortunately, this approach has
	been to no avail; no visual faculty has emerged that appears to require
	ocular dominance columns. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that
	the expression of ocular dominance columns can be highly variable
	among members of the same species, or even in different portions
	of the visual cortex in the same individual. These observations deal
	a fatal blow to the idea that ocular dominance columns serve a purpose.
	More broadly, the term ï¾‘columnï¾’ also denotes the periodic termination
	of anatomical projections within or between cortical areas. In many
	instances, periodic projections have a consistent relationship with
	some architectural feature, such as the cytochrome oxidase patches
	in V1 or the stripes in V2. These tissue compartments appear to divide
	cells with different receptive field properties into distinct processing
	streams. However, it is unclear what advantage, if any, is conveyed
	by this form of columnar segregation. Although the column is an attractive
	concept, it has failed as a unifying principle for understanding
	cortical function. Unravelling the organization of the cerebral cortex
	will require a painstaking description of the circuits, projections
	and response properties peculiar to cells in each of its various
	areas.},

	are formed. In the (phi^6)1+1 theory, we found two physically meaningful

	of a diatomic anion has been proposed. The main purpose of the study
	is to provide a simple model to better understand the effect of strong
	coupling between the solvent polarization and the extra charge in
	a system like I2 2. The model diatomic anion consists of two identical
	nuclei and an extra electron whose dynamics are treated explicitly.
	The effect of solvent polarization is modeled by introducing an effective
	solvent field representing a nonequilibrium solvent configuration.
	Nonadiabatic theoretical calculations, in which the electronic and
	the nuclear dynamics are treated simultaneously, can reveal the importance
	of nonadiabatic effects by including intrinsically all the electronic
	states involved. It is found that a purely dissociative excited state
	can support recombination due to coupling of the anomalous charge
	distribution with the solvent polarization. The charge switching
	and the subsequent charge separation for the dissociating fragments
	are strongly coupled with the fluctuating solvent polarization, as
	represented by the time-dependent solvent field in the present model.
	The results of the calculations with varying time scales for the
	solvent response have demonstrated the possibility of numerous diverse
	phenomena resulting from nonadiabatic transitions. In particular,
	we found charge transfer induced by changing solvent polarization.
	The general model presented in the study provides a reasonable interpretation,
	at least on a qualitative level, for the interesting features obtained
	from recent experiments and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics studies
	on the photodissociation of I2 2 in molecular clusters.},

	3D-reconstruction was used to determine whether boutons of the labeled
	input fibers were in contact with the intracellularly filled neurons.
	We analyzed 12 pyramidal neurons and 21 interneurons. Perforant path
	innervation to pyramidal neurons in our material was observed to
	be denser than that from CA3. All pyramidal neurons and 17 of the
	interneurons received contacts of both perforant pathway and Schaffer
	input on their dendrites and cell bodies. Four interneurons, which
	were completely embedded in LM, received only labeled perforant pathway

	paleocortex, which is retained in present-day reptiles such as the
	turtle. Thus the turtle offers an opportunity to examine which cellular
	and circuit properties are fundamental to cortical function. We characterized
	the dendritic properties of pyramidal neurons in different cortical
	regions of mature turtles, Pseudemys scripta elegans, using whole
	cell recordings and calcium imaging from the axon, soma, and dendrites
	in a slice preparation. The firing properties, in response to intrasomatic
	depolarization, resembled those previously recorded with sharp electrodes
	in this preparation. Somatic spikes led to active backpropagating
	high-amplitude dendritic action potentials and intracellular calcium
	ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) changes at all dendritic locations, suggesting
	that both backpropagation and dendritic voltage-gated Ca2+ channels
	are primitive traits. We found no indication that Ca2+ spikes could
	be evoked in the dendrites, but fast Na+ spikes could be initiated
	there following intradendritic stimulation. Several lines of evidence
	indicate that fast, smaller-amplitude somatic spikes ("prepotentials")
	that are easily recorded in this preparation are generated in the
	axon. Most synaptically activated [Ca2+]i changes resulted from Ca2+
	entry through voltage-gated channels. In some cells synaptic stimulation
	evoked a delayed Ca2+ wave due to release from internal stores following
	activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. With some small differences
	these properties resemble those of pyramidal neurons in mammalian
	species. We conclude that spike backpropagation, dendritic Ca2+ channels,
	and synaptically activated Ca2+ release are primitive and conserved
	features of cortical pyramidal cells, and therefore likely fundamental
	to cortical function.}

  abstract = {When computing descriptors of image data, the type of information
	that can be extracted may be strongly dependent on the scales at
	which the image operators are applied. This article presents a systematic
	methodology for addressing this problem. A mechanism is presented
	for automatic selection of scale levels when detecting one-dimensional
	image features, such as edges and ridges. A novel concept of a scale-space
	edge is introduced, defined as a connected set of points in scale-space
	at which: (i) the gradient magnitude a ssumes a local maximum in
	the gradient direction, and (ii) a normalized measure of the strength
	of the edge response is locally maximal over scales. An important
	consequence of this defi nition is that it allows the scale levels
	to vary along the edge. Two specific measures of edge strength are
	analysed in detail, the gradient magnitude and a differential expression
	derived from the third-order derivative in the gradient direction.
	For a certain way of normalizing these differential descriptors,
	by expressing them in terms of so-called -normalized derivatives,
	an immediate consequence of this deffnition is that the edge detector
	will adapt its scale levels to the local image structure. Specifically,
	sharp edges will be detected at scales so as to reduce the shape
	distortions due to scale-space smoothing, whereas sufficiently coarse
	scales will be selected at diffuse edges, such that an edge model
	is a valid abstraction of the intensity profile across the edge.
	Since the scale-space edge is defined from the intersection of two
	zero-crossing surfaces in scale-space, the edges will by definition
	form closed curves. This simplified selection of salient edges, and
	a novel significance measure is proposed, by integrating the edge
	strength along the edge. Moreover, the scale information associated
	with each edge provides useful clues to the physical nature of the
	edge. With just slight modifications, similar ideas can be used for
	formulating ridge detectors with automatic selection, having the
	characteristic property that the selected scales on a scale-space
	ridge instead reject the width of the ridge. It is shown how the
	methodology can be implemented in terms of straightforward visual
	front-end operations, and the validity of the approach is supported
	by theoretical analysis as well as experiments on real-world and
	synthetic data. Keywords: edge detection, ridge detection, scale
	selection, diffuseness, normalized derivative, Gaussian derivative,

	directly with each other forming junctions. It is possible that some
	links are absent. Instead of solving the diffusion equation for the
	full problem we formulated an approach that is computationally more
	efficient. We derived a set of rate equations that govern the time
	dependence of the number of particles in each container N1(t),N2(t),

	reduced to a set of M first order integro-differential equations

	the assumption that the tubes are thin in comparison to their lengths

	assumptions the containers can be considered ideally mixed at all

	on a couple of examples: networks involving three, four and seven

	simple networks with relatively few containers exhibit interesting
	transport behavior. For example, we showed that it is possible to
	adjust the geometry of the networks so that the particle concentration
	varies in time in a wave-like manner. Such behavior deviates from
	simple exponential growth and decay occurring in the two container
	system. In addition, we showed how to eliminate junctions from the

  abstract = {A set of cosmological variables, which we shall refer to as ï¾‘supercomoving
	variablesï¾’, are presented which are an alternative to the standard
	comoving variables, particularly useful for describing the gas dynamics
	of cosmic structure formation. For an ideal gas with a ratio of specific
	heats g Â¼ 5=3, the supercomoving position, velocity and thermodynamic
	properties (i.e. density, temperature and pressure) of matter are
	constant in time in a uniform, isotropic, adiabatically expanding
	universe. Expressed in terms of these supercomoving variables, the
	non-relativistic, cosmological fluid conservation equations of the
	Newtonian approximation and the Poisson equation closely resemble
	their non-cosmological counterparts. This makes it possible to generalize
	non-cosmological results and techniques to address problems involving
	departures from uniform, adiabatic Hubble expansion in a straightforward
	way, for a wide range of cosmological models. These variables were
	initially introduced by Shandarin to describe structure formation
	in matter-dominated models. In this paper, we generalize supercomoving
	variables to models with a uniform contribution to the energy density
	corresponding to a non-zero cosmological constant, domain walls,
	cosmic strings, a nonclumping form of non-relativistic matter (e.g.
	massive neutrinos in the presence of primordial density fluctuations
	of small wavelength) or a radiation background. Each model is characterized
	by the value of the density parameter Q0 of the non-relativistic
	matter component in which density fluctuation is possible, and the
	density parameter QX0 of the additional nonclumping component. For
	each type of non-clumping background, we identify families within
	which different values of Q0 and QX0 lead to fluid equations and
	solutions in supercomoving variables which are independent of the
	cosmological parameters Q0 and QX0. We also generalize the description
	to include the effects of non-adiabatic processes such as heating,
	radiative cooling, thermal conduction and viscosity, as well as magnetic
	fields in the MHD approximation. As an illustration, we describe
	three familiar cosmological problems in supercomoving variables:
	the growth of linear density fluctuations, the non-linear collapse
	of a 1D plane-wave density fluctuation leading to pancake formation,
	and the well-known Zelï¾’dovich approximation for extrapolating the
	linear growth of density fluctuations in three dimensions to the
	non-linear stage.},

	pyramidal cells (synaptic integration). The mechanisms underlying
	the synaptic integration in thin basal dendrites are largely unexplored.
	We use a recently developed technique, multisite voltage-calcium
	imaging, to compare voltage and calcium transients from multiple
	locations along individual dendritic branches. Our results reveal
	characteristic electrical transients (plateau potentials) that trigger
	and shape dendritic calcium dynamics and calcium distribution during
	suprathreshold glutamatergic synaptic input. We regularly observed
	three classes of voltage-calcium interactions occurring simultaneously
	in three different zones of the same dendritic branch: (1) proximal
	to the input site, (2) at the input site, and (3) distal to the input
	site. One hundred micrometers away from the synaptic input site,
	both proximally and distally, dendritic calcium transients are in
	tight temporal correlation with the dendritic plateau potential.
	However, on the same dendrite, at the location of excitatory input,
	calcium transients outlast local dendritic plateau potentials by
	severalfold. These Ca2+ plateaus (duration 0.5-2 s) are spatially
	restricted to the synaptic input site, where they cause a brief down-regulation
	of dendritic excitability. Ca2+ plateaus are not mediated by Ca2+
	release from intracellular stores, but rather by an NMDA-dependent
	small-amplitude depolarization, which persists after the collapse
	of the dendritic plateau potential. These unique features of dendritic
	voltage and calcium distributions may provide distinct zones for
	simultaneous long-term (bidirectional) modulation of synaptic contacts
	along the same basal branch. },

	magnetic resonance imaging, intrinsic and extrinsic contrast optical
	imaging, and magnetoencephalography, generate large data sets with
	complex content. In this paper we develop appropriate techniques
	for analysis and visualization of such imaging data to separate the
	signal from the noise and characterize the signal. The techniques
	developed fall into the general category of multivariate time series
	analysis, and in particular we extensively use the multitaper framework
	of spectral analysis. We develop specific protocols for the analysis
	of fMRI, optical imaging, and MEG data, and illustrate the techniques
	by applications to real data sets generated by these imaging modalities.
	In general, the analysis protocols involve two distinct stages: ï¾“noiseï¾”
	characterization and suppression, and ï¾“signalï¾” characterization
	and visualization. An important general conclusion of our study is
	the utility of a frequency-based representation, with short, moving
	analysis windows to account for nonstationarity in the data. Of particular
	note are 1) the development of a decomposition technique (space-frequency
	singular value decomposition) that is shown to be a useful means
	of characterizing the image data, and 2) the development of an algorithm,
	based on multitaper methods, for the removal of approximately periodic
	physiological artifacts arising from cardiac and respiratory sources.

  note = {This paper provides relatively clear proof-by-construction of approximate
	version of Kolmogorov theorem, which states that any n-dimensional
	function can be represented as a sum of 2n+1 1D functions of sums
	of n fixed functions with different coefficients (total of n+1 parameters).
	In nut-shell, Kolmogorov theorem is analog of the statement that
	any function of n-dimensional index Z^n is isomorphic to a function
	of 1D index via Z^n->Z. In general, simple index mapping Z^n->Z is
	not continuous as step-discontinuities arise along each "line" of
	the mapping. Kolmogorov's achievement was to provide a construction
	which contribute a continuous map [0,1]^n->[0,1]. Such mapping is
	constructed by finding families of 2n+1 coverings of n-cube of decreasing
	diameter and vanishing overlaps within each family such that each
	point is covered by at least n+1 cubes from these coverings. One
	then is able to construct continuous functions that map each of such
	cubes non-overlaping cubes into distinct points of the [0,1] line
	(!). Therefore, [0,1]^n is continuously mapped 1-1 onto [0,1] and
	any continuous function of [0,1]^n can be seen as (some) continuous
	function of the image of [0,1]^n. Some subtleties are present requiring
	2n+1 such functions each approximating on a subset of n coverings
	at a time. Note that dimensionality curse is not removed since complexity
	of R^n space is translated into extremely complex mapping into R,
	and thus, generally, no gain is achieved for actual interpolation.},
  abstract = {In this paper, we prove constructively two approximative versions
	of the superposition theorem of Kolmogorov (19631, corresponding
	to Lorentz (1962) and Sprecher (1965). The proofs are constructive
	in the sense that only rationals, expressible as finite decimal sums,
	are used. The approximations consist in algorithms with error bounds.
	Concerning their complexity, the two results differ in the way the
	occurring sequences are constructed: recursively, respectively explicitly.},

  abstract = {In the visual cortex of higher mammals, neurons are arranged across
	the cortical surface in an orderly map of preferred stimulus orientations.
	This map contains 'orientation pinwheels', structures that are arranged
	like the spokes of a wheel such that orientation changes continuously
	around a centre. Conventional optical imaging first demonstrated
	these pinwheels, but the technique lacked the spatial resolution
	to determine the response properties and arrangement of cells near
	pinwheel centres. Electrophysiological recordings later demonstrated
	sharply selective neurons near pinwheel centres, but it remained
	unclear whether they were arranged randomly or in an orderly fashion.
	Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in vivo to determine the microstructure
	of pinwheel centres in cat visual cortex with single-cell resolution.
	We find that pinwheel centres are highly ordered: neurons selective
	to different orientations are clearly segregated even in the very
	centre. Thus, pinwheel centres truly represent singularities in the
	cortical map. This highly ordered arrangement at the level of single
	cells suggests great precision in the development of cortical circuits
	underlying orientation selectivity.},

	provides an ideal model for solving the technological problem and
	we discuss in detail the exploitation of specific sensory processing

	the physiological properties of only a handful of retinal ganglion

	of neural activity, the existence of a physiologically distinct population
	of ganglion cells in the primate retina with distinctive visual response
	properties. These cells, which we will refer to as upsilon cells,
	are characterized by large receptive fields, rapid and transient
	responses to light, and significant nonlinearities in their spatial
	summation. Based on the measured properties of these cells, we speculate
	that they correspond to the smooth/large radiate cells recently identified
	morphologically in the primate retina and may therefore provide visual
	input to both the lateral geniculate nucleus and the superior colliculus.
	We further speculate that the upsilon cells may be the primate retina's
	counterparts of the Y-cells observed in the cat and other mammalian

	ized. Modern techniques of confocal laser scanning microscopy and
	serial thin sectioning for in vi vo and in vi tro studies of dendri
	tic spines were discussed, including the relationship between morphological
	changes and the synaptic transmission ef ficiency, in particular,
	using Ã  model of long-term potentiation. Various categories of dendri
	tic spines and postsynaptic densi ti es, and also the role of filopodia
	in spine genesis were analyzed. The serial thin sectioning technique
	was shown to be most efficient for unbiased quantitative stereological
	analysis and three-dimensional reconstructions. Using Ã  ref ined

	mi tochondria in dendr ites of neurons in various regions of the

	averaging at multiple sites during propagation along branched neurites

	of photodamage (PD), a frequent limiting factor in the optical imaging
	of biological preparations. The optical signal and the PD during
	SHG imaging of stained cultured Aplysia neurons were examined with
	intracellular electrode recordings monitoring the resting Vm variations
	induced by laser-scanning illumination. We found that the PD increased
	linearly with the dye concentration but grew with the cube of illumination
	intensity, leading to unanticipated optimization procedures to minimize
	PD. The addition of appropriate antioxidants in conjunction with
	an observed Vm recovery after termination of laser scanning further
	refined the imaging criteria for minimization and control of PD during
	SHG recording of action potentials. With these advances, the potential
	of SHG as an effective optical tool for neuroscience investigations

	pig hippocampus (regions CA1 and CA3) were analyzed by a correlated
	light and electron microscopic approach. Following Golgi impregnation,
	the cells were first studied under the light microscope and classified
	according to the location of their cell bodies and the distribution
	of their dendrites in the different hippocampal layers. Next, the
	Golgi impregnated non-pyramidal neurons were gold-toned and deimpregnated,
	allowing an electron microscopic analysis of the identified structures.
	With regard to cell body location and dendritic pattern, non-pyramidal
	cells are a rather heterogeneous group of neurons. Their perikarya
	were found in all hippocampal layers and their dendrites had a less
	regular orientation when compared to pyramidal neurons and granule
	cells. Two basic types, i.e., "vertical" and "horizontal" non-pyramidal
	neurons are described. Many cells were of an intermediate type with
	dendrites extending in all directions. Non-pyramidal cell dendrites
	were mostly devoid of spines but exhibited numerous varicosities.
	Non-pyramidal cell axons could sometimes be seen extending towards
	the pyramidal cell layer. A surprising uniformity was observed when
	the impregnated, identified non-pyramidal neurons were studied in
	the electron microscope. Their perikarya exhibited a well-developed
	endoplasmic reticulum and indented nuclei. Both the cell bodies and
	the varicose dendrites were densely covered with synaptic boutons
	which mainly formed asymmetric synaptic contacts. Only occasionally
	were symmetric synaptic contacts observed. Non-pyramidal cell dendrites
	extending into the stratum lucidum of CA3 were found to be contacted
	by the giant boutons of mossy fiber axons. In addition to synaptic
	contacts, the dendrites of gold-toned non-pyramidal neurons formed
	gap junctions with neighboring dendrites. The results are discussed
	in relation to recent immunocytochemical studies which have shown
	non-pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus to contain gamma-aminobutyric
	acid and/or various neuropeptides.},

	Our algorithm uses modern numeric techniques to find an approximate
	solution to normalized cut measures in time that is linear in the
	size of the image with only a few dozen operations per pixel. In
	just one pass the algorithm provides a complete hierarchical decomposition
	of the image into segments. The algorithm detects the segments by
	applying a process of recursive coarsening in which the same minimization
	problem is represented with fewer and fewer variables producing an
	irregular pyramid. During this coarsening process we may compute
	additional internal statistics of the emerging segments and use these
	statistics to facilitate the segmentation process. Once the pyramid
	is completed it is scanned from the top down to associate pixels
	close to the boundaries of segments with the appropriate segment.
	The algorithm is inspired by algebraic multigrid (AMG) solvers of
	minimization problems of heat or electric networks. We demonstrate
	the algorithm by applying it to real images.},

	Similarly, we learn probability distributions over filter responses

	model for tracking that exploits the ratio between the likelihood
	that image pixels corresponding to the foreground (person) were generated

	previous work on learning image statistics and combines it with Bayesian

	regions. It is related to hierarchical clustering and multiscale
	clustering/smoothing in a way. No doubt applicable to segmentation
	of different grayscale level/color regions, but uncertain in applicability
	for narrow dark edges detection.},
  abstract = {In this paper, we present a new approach to edge detection. We see
	edges as delineators of local, photometrically coherent clusters
	of pixels. We are concerned with edges at a given pair of photometric
	and spatial scales. We first define the Similarity Region (SR) of
	a pixel as the set of pixels in it's neighborhood that form a local
	cluster with the pixel. The SR is discovered by using an affinity
	measure at the given spatial and photometric scales. It follows then
	that the SR's for two adjacent pixels within a region will be similar
	and they will be different for pixels across a region boundary. This
	property is used to determine if there is an edge between any two
	pixels. SR's of a pixel pair are evaluated for similarity in two
	ways - by comparing their geometric properties and by comparing the
	affinity distributions of pixels within them. This leads to two edge
	operators. The first uses Normalized difference of Moments (NdM)
	of the two SR's, while the second uses a \chi^2-measure of the two
	affinity distributions. These edge operators are fast, they respond
	to local edge freatures like corners faithfully and they do not introduce
	bias or localization errors for images with ESNR (Edge Strength to
	Noise Ratio) greater than 10dB. For higher noise, the methods respond
	to edges of regions formed by noise. For robustness, we propose a
	preprocessing step that clusters data. To this end, we present two
	clustering algorithms based on cost function optimization. The first
	algorithm is an Iterated Mode algorithm that uses the histogram of
	pixel values in a local window to replace each pixel value with a
	value that has higher probability of occurrence at that pixel. The
	second algoruthm minimizes a Soft Clustering Evaluation Function
	(SCEF) to partition the image into clusters such that the mutual
	information between these clusters is minimized. This work is closely
	related to Rosenfeld et al.'s iterative smoothing algoruthms, histogram-based
	techniques and pyramid linking shcmes; these relationships are pointed
	out. We present the responses of edge operators on synthetic and
	real images. The integration of these operators to define coherent
	edge detectors will be reported in the near future.},

	tree are not static, but can be altered by neuromodulators and by

	in synaptic weight among synapses. Two experimental designs were
	used to address this question. In the first experimental design three

	size was computed by three-dimensional reconstruction from serial
	electron microscopy (EM). Serial EM also was used to compute synapse
	number per unit length of dendrite. In both experimental designs

  abstract = {Recent physiological work has used quantal analysis to investigate
	the properties of synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation
	in hippocampal area CA1. These analyses have revealed changes in
	the strength of excitatory post-synaptic responses following long-term
	potentiation that could be mediated by cellular mechanisms in the
	presynaptic element, in the postsynaptic element, or in both elements.
	In these studies, either minimal stimulation, presumably involving
	a single presynaptic axon, or recordings from pairs of CA3 and CA1
	cells have been used. Interpretation of these quantal analyses requires
	knowledge about whether single or multiple synapses occur between
	the presynaptic axon and its target CA1 pyramidal cells. Here, light
	and serial electron microscopy was used to begin to examine this
	question and a related question concerning the ultrastructure of
	spines on multiple-synapse boutons. Light microscopic analyses of
	Golgi preparations revealed that about 20% of the axons occurring
	in stratum radiatum come into close apposition with two to four different
	dendrites of a target CA1 cell. An "apposition" was defined as a
	point where the axons and dendrites crossed in the same focal plane
	and therefore were sufficiently close to allow a dendritic spine
	to reach the axon and possibly establish a synaptic contact. An additional
	4% of the axons wound back and forth across individual dendrites,
	possibly forming multiple synapses closely spaced along the dendrites.
	Serial electron microscopy revealed that 24% of the individual axonal
	boutons in stratum radiatum make synapses with multiple dendritic
	spines arising from either the same or different dendritic segments.
	Two adjacent boutons of the same axon could also be found to synapse
	with different spines of the same dendrite. Together with the light
	microscopic analysis, these observations suggest that multiple synapses
	occur between single axons in stratum radiatum and their target CA1
	cells, and that at least some of these synapses may occur at different
	electronic distances. If these multiple synapses have different physiological
	strengths, then they may obscure or smooth peaks in the frequency
	histograms that are used for quantal analyses. A three-dimensional
	analysis was done to compare the dimensions of pairs of dendritic
	spines synapsing with individual axonal boutons. When the pairs of
	spines associated with a single bouton arose from different dendrites,
	at least some of which were likely to have come from different cells,
	the differences between their volumes and the areas of the postsynaptic
	densities were on average 100% and ranged up to 650%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

	Short vesicular or long vermiform evaginations emerged from dendrites
	and axons and were engulfed by presynaptic or neighboring axons,
	astrocytes, and, surprisingly, a growth cone to form double-membrane
	structures called spinules. In total, 254 spinules were evaluated
	in 326 micron^3 of stratum radiatum in area CA1 of mature rat hippocampus.
	Spinules emerged from spine heads (62%), necks (24%), axons (13%),
	dendritic shafts (1%), or nonsynaptic protrusions (<1%) and invaginated
	into axons (<90%), astrocytic processes (<8%), or a growth cone (<1%).
	Coated pits occurred on the engulfing membrane at the tips of most
	spinules ( 69%), and double-membrane structures occurred freely in
	axonal and astrocytic cytoplasm, suggesting trans-endocytosis. Spinule
	locations differed among mushroom and thin spines. For mushroom spines,
	most (84%) of the spinules were engulfed by presynaptic axons, 16%
	by neighboring axons, and none by astrocytic processes. At thin spines,
	only 17% of the spinules were engulfed by presynaptic axons, whereas
	67% were engulfed by neighboring axons and 14% by astrocytic processes.
	Spinules engulfed by astrocytic processes support the growing evidence
	that perisynaptic glia interact directly with synapses at least on
	thin spines. Spinules with neighboring axons may provide a mechanism
	for synaptic competition in the mature brain. Trans-endocytosis of
	spinules by presynaptic axons suggest retrograde signaling or coordinated
	remodeling of presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes to remove transient
	perforations and assemble the postsynaptic density of large synapses
	on mushroom spines.},

  abstract = {We outline a different method of describing scalar field particle
	production in a uniform electric field. In the standard approach,
	the (analytically continued) harmonic oscillator paradigm is important
	in describing particle production. In the gauges normally considered,
	in which the four vector potential depends only on the time or space
	coordinate, the system reduces to a non-relativistic effective SchrÂ¨odinger
	equation with an inverted oscillator potential. The Bogolubov coefficients
	are determined by tunnelling in this potential. In the Schwinger
	proper time method of determining the effective Lagrangian, the analytically
	continued propagator for the usual oscillator system is regarded
	as the correct propagator for the inverted oscillator system and
	is used to obtain the gauge invariant result. However, there is another
	gauge in which the particle production process has striking similarities
	with the one used to describe Hawking radiation in black holes. The
	gauge we use to describe the electric field in is the lightcone gauge,
	so named because the mode functions for a scalar field are found
	to be singular on the lightcone. We use these modes in evaluating
	the effective Lagrangian using the proper time technique. The key
	feature of this analysis is that these modes can be explicitly ï¾“normalizedï¾”
	by using the criterion that they reduce to the usual flat space modes
	in the limit of the electric field tending to zero. This normalization
	procedure allows one to determine the Schwinger proper time kernel
	without using the analytical continuation of the harmonic oscillator
	kernel that is resorted to in the standard analysis. We find that
	the proper time kernel is not the same as the analytically continued
	oscillator kernel though the effective Lagrangian is the standard
	result as it should be. We also consider an example of a confined
	electric field system using the lightcone gauge modes that has several
	features of interest. In particular, our analysis indicates that
	the Bogolubov coefficients, in taking the limit to the uniform electric
	field case, are multiplied by energy dependent boundary factors that
	have not been taken into account before.},

	a systematic study of LF-quantized gauge theory following the Dirac
	method and construct the Dyson-Wick S-matrix expansion based on LF-time-ordered
	products. The free theory gauge field is shown to satisfy the Lorentz
	condition as an operator equation as well as the light-cone gauge
	condition. Its propagator is found to be transverse with respect
	to both its four-momentum and the gauge direction. The interaction
	Hamiltonian of QCD can be expressed in a form resembling that of
	covariant theory, except for additional instantaneous interactions
	which can be treated systematically. The renormalization constants
	in YM theory are shown to satisfy the identity Z1 = Z3 at one loop

	agrees with that known in the conventional framework. Some comments

	in a relatively high tortuosity, small branch length of these axons,
	and correlations of their trajectories with the positions of postsynaptic
	neuron dendrites. Axons of PCs show no such specificity, usually
	taking a relatively straight course through neuropil. However, wiring
	patterns among PCs hold a large potential for circuit remodeling
	and specificity through growth and retraction of dendritic spines.

	In a formal representation for teh Schwinger functional, we treat

	a perturbative expansion around the ultra-local model, where fields

	first study the strong-coupling expansion in the lambda phi^4_d theory
	and also quantum electrodynamics. Assuming the ultra-local approximation,
	we examine the singularities of these perturbative expansions, analysing
	the analytic structrure of the zero-dimensional generating functions

	phi^-p(x), and the sinh-Gordon model, i.e. L_III(g_3,g_4;phi)=g_3(cosh(g_4

	expansion two different steps are used throughout the paper. First,

	functional associated with these scalar models, going beyond the
	ultra-local approximation without using a lattice regularization

	of its output spike train with the synaptic inputs was modulated
	by the degree of synchrony of the inhibitory inputs. When inhibitory
	synchrony increased, the coherence of spiking model neurons with
	the synaptic input increased, but the firing rate either increased
	or remained the same. The mean number of synchronous inhibitory inputs
	was a key determinant of the shape of the firing rate versus current
	(fÂ–I) curves. For a large number of inhibitory inputs (50), the
	fÂ–I curve saturated for large I and an increase in input synchrony
	resulted in a shift of sensitivityÂ—the model neuron responded to
	weaker inputs I. For a small number (10), the fÂ–I curves were non-saturating
	and an increase in input synchrony led to an increase in the gain
	of the responseÂ—the firing rate in response to the same input was
	multiplied by an approximately constant factor. The firing rate modulation
	with inhibitory synchrony was highest when the input network oscillated
	in the gamma frequency range. Thus, the observed changes in firing
	rate and coherence of neurons in the visual cortex could be controlled
	by top-down inputs that regulated the coherence in the activity of
	a local inhibitory network discharging at gamma frequencies.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a computational paradigm called Data Driven M
	arkov Chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC) for image segmentation in the Bayesian
	statistical framework. The paper contrubutes to image segmentation
	in three aspects. Firstly, it designs effective and well balanced
	Markov Chain dynamics to explore the solution space and makes the
	split and merge process reversible at a middle level vision formulation.
	Thus it achieves globally optimal solution independent of initial
	segmentations. Secondly, instead of computing a single maximum a
	posteriori solution, it proposes a mathematical principle for computing
	multiple distinct solutions to incorporate intrinsic ambiguities
	in image segmentation. A k-adventurers algorithm is proposed for
	extracting distinct multiple solutions from the Markov chain sequence.
	Thirdly, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) techniques, such as
	clustering and edge detection, to compute importance proposal probabilities,
	which effectively drive the Markov chain dynamics and achieve tremendous
	speedup in comparison to traditional jump-diffusion method [4]. Thus
	DDMCMC paradigm provides a unifying framework where the role of existing
	segmentation algorithms, such as, edge detection, clustering, region
	growing, split-,erge, SNAKEs, region competition, are revealed as
	either realizing Markov chain dynamics or computing importance proposal

	important aspect of visual signaling. However, the precision of spike
	trains has not yet been described in primate retina. The spike time

	modulation. At the onset of clearly delineated periods of firing,
	retinal ganglion cells fired spikes time-locked to the stimulus with
	a variability across trials as low as 1 ms. Spike count variance
	across trials was much lower than the mean and sometimes approached
	the minimum variance possible with discrete counts, inconsistent
	with Poisson statistics expected from independently generated spikes.
	Spike time and count variability decreased systematically with stimulus

  abstract = {We constructed a simple and compact imaging system designed specifically
	for the recording of fast neuronal activity in a 3D volume. The system
	uses an Yb:KYW femtosecond laser we designed for use with acousto-optic
	deflection. An integrated two-axis acousto-optic deflector, driven
	by digitally synthesized signals, can target locations in three dimensions.
	Data acquisition and the control of scanning are performed by a LeCroy
	digital oscilloscope. The total cost of construction was one order
	of magnitude lower than that of a typical Ti:sapphire system. The
	entire imaging apparatus, including the laser, fits comfortably onto
	a small rig for electrophysiology. Despite the low cost and simplicity,
	the convergence of several new technologies allowed us to achieve
	the following capabilities: i) full-frame acquisition at video rates
	suitable for patch clamping; ii) random access in under ten microseconds
	with dwelling ability in the nominal focal plane; iii) three-dimensional
	random access with the ability to perform fast volume sweeps at kilohertz
	rates; and iv) fluorescence lifetime imaging. We demonstrate the
	ability to record action potentials with high temporal resolution
	using intracellularly loaded potentiometric dye di-2-ANEPEQ. Our
	design proffers easy integration with electrophysiology and promises
	a more widespread adoption of functional two-photon imaging as a
	tool for the study of neuronal activity. The software and firmware

	the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose
	of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete

  abstract = {Background: The electroencephalogram (EEG) reflects the electrical
	activity in the brain on the surface of scalp. A major challenge
	in this field is the localization of sources in the brain responsible
	for eliciting the EEG signal measured at the scalp. In order to estimate
	the location of these sources, one must correctly model the sources,
	i.e., dipoles, as well as the volume conductor in which the resulting
	currents flow. In this study, we investigate the effects of dipole
	depth and orientation on source localization with varying sets of
	simulated random noise in 4 realistic head models. Methods: Dipole
	simulations were performed using realistic head models and using
	the boundary element method (BEM). In all, 92 dipole locations placed
	in temporal and parietal regions of the head with varying depth and
	orientation were investigated along with 6 different levels of simulated
	random noise. Localization errors due to dipole depth, orientation
	and noise were investigated. Results: The results indicate that there
	are no significant differences in localization error due tangential
	and radial dipoles. With high levels of simulated Gaussian noise,
	localization errors are depth-dependant. For low levels of added
	noise, errors are similar for both deep and superficial sources.
	Conclusion: It was found that if the signal-to-noise ratio is above
	a certain threshold, localization errors in realistic head models
	are, on average the same for deep and superficial sources. As the
	noise increases, localization errors increase, particularly for deep
	sources.},

  year = {|2001|},
  volume = {555},
  pages = {504},
  abstract = {Strong lensing is a powerful probe of the distribution of matter in
	the cores of clusters of galaxies. Recent studies suggest that the
	cold dark matter model predicts cores that are denser than those
	observed in galaxies, groups, and clusters. One possible resolution
	of the discrepancy is that the dark matter has strong interactions
	(SIDM), which leads to lower central densities. A generalized form
	of the Navarro, Frenk, & White profile (Zhao profile) can be used
	to describe these halos. In this paper we examine gravitational lensing
	statistics for this class of model. The optical depth to multiple
	imaging is a very sensitive function of the profile parameters in
	the range of interest for SIDM halos around clusters of galaxies.
	Less concentrated profiles, which result from larger self-interaction
	cross sections, can produce many fewer lensed pairs. Furthermore,
	profiles that result in a small optical depth exhibit reduced typical
	splittings, but produce multiple images that are more highly magnified.
	However, the resulting increased magnification bias does not alter
	our conclusions. We find that lensing statistics based on profile
	parameters obtained from fits out to the virial radius are dependent
	on the minimization scheme adopted, and may be seriously in error.
	However, profile fits weighted toward the core region have parameter
	degeneracies that are approximately equivalent to those for strong-lensing
	cross sections. Lensing statistics provide a powerful test for SIDM.
	More realistic and observationally oriented calculations remain to
	be done; however, larger self-interaction cross sections may well
	be ruled out by the very existence of strong lenses on galaxy cluster
	scales. The inclusion of centrally dominant cluster galaxies should
	boost the cross section to multiple imaging. However, our preliminary
	calculations suggest that the additional multiple imaging rate is
	small with respect to the differences in multiple imaging rate for
	different halo profiles. In future statistical studies, it will be
	important to properly account for the scatter among halo profiles,
	since the optical depth to multiple imaging is dominated by the most
	concentrated members of a cluster population.},

	This degree is governed by one parameter p. Changing this parameter

	assortative (p = 1). We apply the algorithm to a BarabÂ´asi-Albert
	scale-free network and show that the degree of assortativity is an
	important parameter governing geometrical and transport properties
	of networks. Thus, the diameter of the network and the clustering
	coefficient increase dramatically with the degree of assortativity.
	Moreover, the concentration dependences of the size of the giant
	component in the node percolation problem for uncorrelated and assortative
	networks are strongly different.},

	in several reg- ularization and renormalization prescriptions and

	The beta function in the broken phase becomes neg- ative and the
	UV fixed point turns out to be a strong-coupling one, and its numeric
	value varies with the renormalization prescriptions, a detail which
	is different from the asymptotic free solution in the one loop case.
	The symmetry breaking phase is shown to be an entirely strong-coupling
	phase. The reason of the relevance of the renormalization prescriptions
	is shown to be due to the nonperturbative nature of the effective
	potential. We also reanalyzed the two loop effective potential by
	adopting a differential equation approach based on the understanding
	that takes all the QFTï¾’s as the ill-defined formulations of the
	ï¾’low energyï¾’ effective theories of a complete under- lying theory.
	Then the relevance of the prescriptions of fixing the local ambiguities

	We also tenta- tively proposed a rescaling insensitivity argument
	for fixing the quadratic ambiguities. Some detailed properties of
	the strongly coupled broken phase and related issues were discussed.},
